            <h1>Electric and Hybrid vehicles</h1>
            <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids represent the future of sustainable transportation, offering cleaner alternatives to traditional fuel-powered cars. By combining advanced battery technology and energy efficiency, they help reduce emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row" style="text-align: center;">
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 mb-4" style="background-color:#98CD00;">
                <h2 style="margin-bottom: 22px; margin-top: 25px">The History</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">The history of electric vehicles (EVs) dates back to the early 1800s, when inventors in Europe and the U.S. began experimenting with battery-powered carriages. By the early 1900s, EVs were quite popular, especially in cities, because they were quieter and easier to operate than gasoline cars. However, with the rise of mass production led by Henry Ford and the availability of cheap oil, internal combustion engines became dominant, and EVs faded away for nearly a century. Hybrids emerged much later, with the first mass-produced hybrid car being the Toyota Prius, launched in Japan in 1997. The Prius became a global success and marked the beginning of modern hybrid technology.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">Interest in EVs surged again in the 2000s due to growing environmental concerns and advancements in battery technology. Companies like Tesla revolutionized the EV market by proving that electric cars could be powerful, stylish, and practical. Since then, nearly every major car manufacturer has developed their own line of EVs or hybrids, making them an essential part of the global transition toward sustainable transportation.</p>

                <h2>How they work and their production</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Hybrids are designed to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency compared to traditional gasoline cars. EVs run entirely on electricity stored in a rechargeable battery, which powers an electric motor to move the vehicle. They produce no tailpipe emissions and can be charged at home or public stations.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">Hybrids, on the other hand, combine a gasoline engine with an electric motor. The battery in a hybrid is charged through regenerative braking and the engine itself, allowing the car to switch between electric and fuel modes or use both for better fuel economy.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">In terms of production, EVs and hybrids require fewer moving parts than traditional engines, but they depend heavily on advanced batteries, especially lithium-ion. Manufacturing these batteries involves mining materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel, followed by complex chemical processing and assembly. Automakers also design specialized electric drivetrains and control systems to manage power distribution. As technology improves, the production of EVs and hybrids is becoming more efficient and sustainable, driving the shift toward cleaner transportation.</p>

            <h1>AI and Machine Learning</h1>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning are revolutionizing the way machines learn from data and make decisions. These technologies power everything from smart assistants to self-driving cars, shaping a smarter and more automated world.</p>
        </div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 mb-4" style="background-color:#6EACDA;">
                <h2>History of AI Development</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) began in the 1950s when scientists first explored the idea of creating machines that could think like humans. In 1956, the term "Artificial Intelligence" was officially introduced at a conference at Dartmouth College, marking the start of AI as a field of study. Early efforts focused on basic problem-solving and symbolic logic, but limited computing power held progress back. In the 1980s, AI research saw renewed interest through "expert systems," which used programmed rules to make decisions. However, these systems struggled with flexibility and real-world data.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">A major breakthrough came in the 2000s with the rise of machine learning — where computers learn from data instead of just following fixed rules. As computing power increased and large datasets became available, AI rapidly evolved. The 2010s brought deep learning, a powerful form of AI that uses neural networks to recognize patterns in images, speech, and text. This led to technologies like voice assistants, facial recognition, and chatbots. Today, AI continues to grow rapidly, powering everything from search engines and recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles and medical diagnostics.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 mb-4" style="background-color:#6EACDA;">
                <h2>How AI works and their training process</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">Artificial Intelligence (AI) works by enabling machines to mimic human intelligence, such as recognizing patterns, making decisions, or understanding language. At the core of AI is a process called machine learning, where algorithms learn from large sets of data instead of being manually programmed. The training process begins by feeding the AI system a massive amount of labeled data — for example, images of cats and dogs — so it can learn to recognize patterns and make accurate predictions. During training, the AI adjusts internal parameters through repeated trial and error, guided by a mathematical model called a neural network. This network processes input data through layers, gradually improving its ability to detect correct outcomes. Over time, with enough data and computing power, the system "learns" to perform tasks like recognizing faces, translating languages, or recommending videos.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">More advanced AI, like ChatGPT, is trained on diverse text sources and fine-tuned to generate human-like responses. The quality of an AI's performance heavily depends on the quality and diversity of its training data, the model design, and the optimization process used to reduce errors.</p>

                <h2>History of Space exploration</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">The history of space exploration began during the Cold War, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 in 1957 — the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth. This sparked a global space race, leading to landmark achievements like Yuri Gagarin becoming the first human in space in 1961, and the U.S. landing Apollo 11 on the Moon in 1969. Since then, space agencies like NASA, ESA, Roscosmos, and more recently private companies like SpaceX, have expanded our reach beyond Earth.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">Space exploration has led to countless scientific discoveries, from understanding the origins of planets to detecting distant galaxies. It has also contributed significantly to life on Earth — improving global communication, weather forecasting, GPS navigation, and even advancing materials and medical technologies originally developed for space missions.</p>

                <h2>How AI Spacecraft and Satellites work</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">Spacecraft are vehicles designed to travel in space, either carrying humans or robotic instruments. They use propulsion systems, such as chemical rockets or ion thrusters, to maneuver through space, and rely on solar panels or nuclear power for energy.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">Satellites, a type of spacecraft, are placed into orbit around Earth or other celestial bodies. They function by sending and receiving signals for communication, navigation, or scientific observation. Most satellites follow specific orbits — like geostationary or polar — depending on their purpose. Instruments onboard may monitor climate, scan the Earth’s surface, or relay signals between continents. Together, spacecraft and satellites enable critical technologies we rely on every day and drive the ongoing exploration of our universe.</p>
